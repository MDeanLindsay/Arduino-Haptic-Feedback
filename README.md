# Arduino Haptic Feedback
Supplementary Parts Used:
- Raspberry PI
- 5V Power Relay
- External Bluetooth dongle 

Haptic feedback is used loosely (albeit recklessly), but the script can be used to trigger whatever device is desired through raspberry pi.
Providing devices power supply can be stripped, the 5V relay can be used to switch 120-140V current for most household electronics.

OpenCV parameters are configured to match 1980 x 1080 display of a specic test game's font to capture health values.
Updating OCR can/may be required depending on targeted games stylized UI's to properly capture values.
